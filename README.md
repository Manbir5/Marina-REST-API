# Marina-REST-API

This is a collection of files that were used to create a REST API on the Google Cloud Platform. 

The .env file and connection information are not provided for security reasons. However, an 
individual can use these files along with their own personal connection or account on
Google Cloud Platform to create a similar API. 

The specifications for this API can be found on API_specifications.pdf.
